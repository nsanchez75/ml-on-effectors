## Experiments: Data and Results

### 10/25/2023

- ran AlphaFold2 Colab file on test sequences (found in data) similar to how I had run the data on ESMFold
  - made sure to omit the '*' at the end of the sequences
  - didn't touch anything in the Colab (just did 'Run All' like it says to do in the Colab)
- results found in 10/25/2023

### 11/1/2023

- found some sequences in Uniprot that come from Bremia Lactucae. Apparently, Alphafold provides predicted structures for the sequences. Link: <https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=(taxonomy_id:4779)>
- I created the fasta file `uniprotkb_taxonomy_id_4779_2023_11_01.fasta` by downloading a fasta file from the website above. The file lists all of the Bremia lactucae sequences found in the Uniprot database.
- I will use this to extract all of the Uniprot accession IDs so that I can download all of the AlphaFold predictions associated with Bremia lactucae.
- The predictions may be found in this dataset on Google Cloud: <https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/public-datasets-deepmind-alphafold-v4;tab=objects?prefix=&forceOnObjectsSortingFiltering=false>
