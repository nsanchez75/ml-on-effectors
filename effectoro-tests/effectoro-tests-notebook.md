# EffectorO Tests

## Running EffectorO

Created a Conda environment `effectoro.yml` that can be used to run EffectorO

Ran EffectorO on `B_lac-SF5.protein.fasta` to test it and it works

## Running EffectorO Before SignalP

Created programs that would run EffectorO first and then SignalP and vice versa

**TODO: Check in with Kelsey to see if I'm doing things properly (pipelines are in my frappe stuff)**
